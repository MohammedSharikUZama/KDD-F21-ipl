## Project Introduction:

Cricket is also referred as Game of Uncertainty and there is no precise forecast that can predict a specific team would win in any given conditions. Popularity of cricket increased when ICC (International Cricket Council) started concept of fast cricket in the form of twenty-20(T-20) matches. 

IPL is a franchise-based T-20 Cricket competition organized by BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India). The first season of IPL was played in 2008 and its popularity is increasing ever since. Within a short period, IPL has become the highest revenue generating league of India.

Data Analytics has been a part of Sports entertainment for a long time and being a cricket fan visualizing the statistics of cricket is mesmerizing. With the help of past data and knowledge base, we aim to use the Existing Data Analysis and Machine learning techniques to predict the winner of a particular IPL match.

## Research Questions:

Results of every match in the IPL depends on the various conditions like venue, player performance, toss, performance in power play etc.

Results of a match can only be predicted to some extent if previous player performance, venue and 
other match related data is available.

We aim to develop some meaningful features such as prior probabilities of winning for each team, prior probability of team winning the cup etc. 

By using this information, we are planning to build a classifier which predicts the winning probabilities for the playing teams.

Also, a regression task can be implemented which can predict runs scored by current batting team at the end of the inning.
//Target Population- Cricketers playing in various teams of Indian Premier League from 2008 to 2020.
Results of every match in the IPL depends on the various conditions like venue, player performance, toss, performance in power play etc.
//Prescriptive analysis to see which batsman is good against which bowler and vice versa.
//Research question: "What is the probability of winning a match given features like previous player performance, venue and 
other match related data is available."
"What are the top features that affect the chances of winning the match."
